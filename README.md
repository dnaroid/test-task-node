Build a simple PHP/Node.JS/python/go Micro-Service with 3 REST-API Endpoints. Use Docker and publish the repository to github. You can use any components u want. Send us the the link.

Routes:
- GET / (should echo “Hello”)
- GET /hello/{slug} (should echo “Hello {slug}“)
- POST /post (should echo POST-Body as string)

Clean Code and standards wins!
